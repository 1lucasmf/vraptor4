## Really simple!

  <div class="home-example-column" markdown="1">
Your first logic on `FirstController.java`:

~~~
#!java
@Controller
public class FirstController {
  @Get("/home")
  public void home() {
  }
}
~~~
  </div>

  <div class="home-example-column" markdown="1">
And HTML file inside `WEB-INF/jsp/first/home.jsp`:

~~~
#!jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    Initial page
  </body>
</html>
~~~
  </div>

It's done! Now you may just access [localhost:8080/home](http://localhost:8080/home). See more examples [on our documentation](/en/docs/one-minute-guide).
