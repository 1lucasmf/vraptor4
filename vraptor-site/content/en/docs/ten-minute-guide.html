#Starting a project: an e-commerce

##A product CRUD

We will start the system with product registration. For that, we will need a class that models a product and we will also use it to save products in a database, using JPA/Hibernate:

~~~ 
#!java
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private Double price;

    // getter and setters and other necessary business methods
}
~~~

We also need a class that will manage product registration, dealing with web requests. This class will be the products Controller:

~~~ 
#!java
public class ProductsController {
}
~~~

The `ProductController` class will expose URIs that can be accessed through the web, i.e., it will expose your application resources. This type of classes have to annotated with `@Controller`:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class ProductsController {
}
~~~

Whenever you annotate a class with `@Controller` all its public methods are accessible through the web. Take the list method as an example:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class ProductsController {
    public List<Product> list() {
        return new ArrayList<Product>();
    }
}
~~~

VRaptor will automatically redirect all request to `/products/list` to this method. That, of course, means the convention for URI's is `/<controller_name>/<method name>`. After the method is executed, VRaptor will dispatch the request to `/WEB-INF/jsp/products/list.jsp`, and that is because VRaptor's convention is to dispatch it to `/WEB-INF/jsp/<controller_name>/<method_name>.jsp`, by default.

The method `list` returns a product's list, and you can access it at the JSP through request attributes. For that example, an attribute called `productList` can be found at that JSP:

~~~ 
#!jsp
<ul>
<c:forEach items="${productList}" var="product">
    <li>${product.name} - ${product.description}</li>
</c:forEach>
</ul>
~~~

The exported attribute name convention is quite intuitive: if it is a Collection, the attribute will have the `List` sufix; in case it is a regular class, its name is the same as the class, but in lower case. For example, if you method returns a `Product`, you will be able to access it at the JSP through `${product}`. Exporting more than one object to the page is a topic we will cover at another chapter.
